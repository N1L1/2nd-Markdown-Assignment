### **The Monty Hall Problem**
#### <span style ="color:blue"> Briefly discuss the Monty Hall problem and share your insights and solution to this brain teaser problem.

|           The **Monty Hall problem** is a probability puzzle named after the late Monty Hall, the original host of the TV show Let’s Make a Deal. In this problem, there are *3 doors*. Behind 1 door is *a car*; the grand prize that the contestant can win, while behind the other 2 doors contain *goats*. The contestant chooses a door at random which he or she believes is the door that contains the grand prize. The game host then opens one of the 2 remaining doors which reveals one of the goats inside. Now the contestant has the option to stick with his or her chosen door or switch to the other or remaining door to win the prize. The majority of people assume that both doors have the same probability to win, where the door you chose and the door that was left unopened have a 50/50 chance. Because there is no perceived reason to change, most stick with their initial choice. However, in terms of chances, that is not the case.

|           The chances of actually winning the car is, at first, distributed equally among each door, meaning that each door will have a ⅓ chance of containing the grand prize. If a contestant chooses 1 door, he or she will have a ⅓ chance of having the grand prize, and it would stay that way if he or she sticks with his or her chosen door. That would mean that there must be a ⅔ chance that the car is on the other 2 doors. However, even though the host had already revealed the contents of the second door, the contestant would still have a ⅔ chance of winning the grand prize if he or she switches. The odds are better if you switch because the host curates the remaining choices (Statistics How to, 2021).

|           To better understand the concept of probability in this game, let us look into the answer of columnist Marilyn vos Savant in her magazine Parade when she was asked about the same problem. According to her, there is about 66% chance (roughly ⅔) of winning the prize by switching (Frost, 2021). This is because there are only nine different combinations of choices and outcomes. Let us refer to this table:

```{r chunk-name, echo=FALSE}
row1<-c("1", "1", "1", "2", "2", "2", "3", "3", "3", "")
row2<-c("1", "2", "3", "1", "2", "3", "1", "2", "3", "")
row3<-c("Win", "Lose", "Lose", "Lose", "Win", "Lose", "Lose", "Lose", "Win", "3 Wins (About 33%)")
row4<-c("Lose", "Win", "Win", "Win", "Lose", "Win", "Win", "Win", "Lose", "6 Wins (About 66%)")
title<-data.frame(row1, row2, row3, row4)
title
knitr::kable(title, "pipe", col.name=c("Contestant's initial door", "Door with prize", "Don't Switch", "Switch"), align=c("c", "c", "c", "c"))
```

|           The first column contains the numbers 1, 2 and 3 which represent each of the doors or labels each door. Meanwhile, the second column represents the door that has the prize. The third and fourth column tells whether the contestant wins or loses the game if he or she either sticks with his or her first choice or switches to the other door respectively. By enumerating these nine different combinations of choices and outcomes, we now have different potential situations where we could analyze the probability of winning between switching and not switching the contestant’s first choice. In the third column which represents the outcome if the contestant didn’t switch, most of the result would indicate that the contestant would have a 33% chance of winning if he or she sticks with his or her first choice; having a total of 3 wins and 6 losses considering all 9 scenarios. Meanwhile, if the contestant switches his or her door for the other unopened door, then he or she would have a bigger chance to win; having a total of 6 wins and 3 losses considering all 9 scenarios, which gives him or her a 66% chance of winning. If we compare the probabilities of winning between switching and not switching the door, then from the probability percentages we could conclude that the contestant would usually have a better chance of winning the prize if he or she switches his or her choice.<br>

|             Still not convinced that switching would give us a better chance of winning? Then let’s try increasing the number of doors, from a measly 3 to a hundred. Each door would now have 1/100 chance of containing the prize. The contestant still picks one door, but the host opens 98 doors so that the contestant would have the option to either stick with the door he or she initially chose or switch to the other. If we always keep our original door, then our probability of getting the car is the probability we choose the door on the first try, which is 1/100. If we choose to always switch, then our probability of ultimately getting the car is the probability we choose a goat times the probability we switch from a goat to a car. Our probability of picking a goat initially is clearly 99/100. Then, once we pick a goat and one goat door is opened, there are 98 other doors, one of which contains the prize. This would mean that our chance of switching from a goat door to a car door, or the chance of guessing correctly after switching is 1/98, which also demonstrates sampling without replacement. 

Here is the solution for solving the probability of winning the prize by switching:

Let P(A) be the Probability of getting a goat
Let P(B|A) be the Probability of guessing correctly after switching
Let P(A *intersection* B) be the Probability of getting the prize or winning by switching

$$ P(A)= \frac{99}{100} $$
$$ P(B|A) = \frac{1}{98}$$
$$ P(A \bigcap B) = P(A)*P(B|A) = \frac{99}{100} * \frac{1}{98} \approx 0.0101 $$

|           Now let's compare that to the probability of getting the prize on the first try, which is 1/100 or approximately 0.01. You'll notice that the Probability of getting the prize or winning by switching is **slightly greater** than the probability of getting the prize on the first try of sticking with the initially chosen door (0.0101 > 0.1). This would still indicate that we would usually have a higher chance of getting the prize if we ultimately switch from our first choice rather than sticking with our first choice.

### **The PSCO Lottery**
#### <span style ="color:blue"> One of the most popular major games of PCSO is the Ultra Lotto 6/58. At ₱20 per ticket, how much would a bettor spend to cover all of the possible combinations. Would the grand prize of ₱50 million cover all the expenses or it would simply incur a massive loss on the bettor?

![PCSO Logo](https://scontent.fmnl4-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/74602780_3029414650418286_6084237558978445312_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_eui2=AeFxiD0eRGZjIo5xHm1JZugSW5UF5UUcNKJblQXlRRw0okZi5JSfg645-NqYxRqcR1poE0cNUo5gEh8PdOombRXR&_nc_ohc=OG6n8o3lQkMAX-wBHEM&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl4-5.fna&oh=29f8b6de6f1efeae6d830e4fdf02678f&oe=60F48579){width=10%}

The **PCSO Lottery Draw** is *a television game show produced by the Philippine Charity Sweeptakes Office (PCSO)* that started airing since March 8, 1995 on People's Television Network Channel (PTV). The program consists of drawing of parimutuel and fixed payout lottery games, sweepstakes games such as Lotto 6/42, Mega Lotto 6/45, Super Lotto 6/49, Grand Lotto 6/55, Ultra Lotto 6/58, and other fixed payout games.</p>
    
The PCSO runs a variation of the lottery with 6 numbers, all from one to fifty-eight, which is the Ultra Lotto 6/58 event. The rules of the PCSO are simple, if the set of numbers picked by the host matches the numbers on your ticket, you win a prize pool of money! Take note the more winners there are, the more your prize pool is split.</p>

This sounds like a lucrative to make money because of the massive prize pool and possible profit you gain from a single ticket, which costs  ₱20. But with the lotto being the lotto, the odds are guaranteed to be stacked against everyone who participates, including you. So in this problem, we will find out just how much money it will take to have a 100% chance of finding the lucky number.</p>

**A few important points about the PCSO lotto if you have never played it before:**

<ol>

<li>Six number balls will be picked from 1 – 58 through a vacuum system, assuring unpredictability</li> 

<li>Once a ball is taken out, it is removed from the pool of possible numbers</li>

<li>The order of the numbers do not matter</li>

</ol>

These points warrant the usage of the Combination Formula:

$$ _{n}C_{k}= \frac{n!}{n!(n-k)!} $$
Where ***n*** is the **total number of possible numbers (58)**

And ***k*** is the **number of numbers being picked (6)**


We will be using the **combination formula** *because the order does not matter as long as you have the matching numbers to the ones the machine have picked.* This formula will help us find the total number of tickets we need to buy to guarantee a chance at winning the lottery. Inserting our known values into the formula gives us

$$ _{58}C_{6}= \frac{58!}{58!(58-6)!} $$
which is equal to: **40, 475, 358 lottery tickets**. With each ticket costing ₱20, multiplying the value gained with 20 will give us the total amount of money we need to spend to guarantee a win.

$$ 40, 475, 358*₱20 = ₱809,507,160$$

Now that is a ton of money. With the theoretical grand prize being 
₱50,000,000, let us see how much we will gain by buying that many tickets for that amount of money.

$$ ₱50,000,000 - ₱809,507,160 = ₱-759,507,160 $$
Now I do not know about you, but this feels like a net loss of astronomical scale.</p>

In conclusion, spending enough money to have a 100% chance of winning the lottery would incur a financial loss on the bettor, one they would never be able to recover from, even if they win the lottery three times over.</p>

The sheer amount of possible numbers in the lottery and the millions of bettors ensure its continued activities, meaning the ones running it will always make sure the odds are stacked against each individual bettor. In the off-chance that you do win the lottery, just know that you pulled of something that only happens to one in over forty million possibilities. </p>
